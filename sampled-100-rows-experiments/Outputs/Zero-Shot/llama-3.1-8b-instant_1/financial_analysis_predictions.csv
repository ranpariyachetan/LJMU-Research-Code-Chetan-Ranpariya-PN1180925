However, based on the context, we can infer some strategies that GM might be using for environmental and emission regulations compliance. 

GM must obtain certification that its vehicles and engines meet emission requirements of the EPA and CARB before selling vehicles in the U.S., Canada, and states adopting California emission standards. This implies that GM is taking steps to ensure compliance with these regulations.

1. Obtaining certification for its vehicles and engines to meet EPA and CARB emission requirements.
2. Adapting to the Tier 4 Multipollutant Rule by increasing the production of zero-emission vehicles.
